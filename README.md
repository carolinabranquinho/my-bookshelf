# MyBookshelf ðŸ“š

MyBookshelf is a book-tracking app inspired by GoodReads, offering a better UI and more ways to organize your books. Create custom lists, track your reading, and explore new readsâ€”all with a user-friendly experience.

## Architecture

**1. Folder Structure**

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api # Api functions.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components # Abstraction of reusable components.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config # Application and Third-party configurations, environment variables, for instance.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data # Data layer (currently using TanStack query).
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”œâ”€â”€ specs # E2E tests.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures # Mocked API responses.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page-object-models # Abstractions of pages.
```

**2. Third-Party Abstractions**

Interaction and integration with third parties are abstracted under the data and API layers, such that only the functions inside `src/api` are aware of the implementation details. The rest of the application uses the data layer, which is agnostic.

**3. Colocated Files**

Colocated Files organize related components, utils, and tests together to improve maintainability, discoverability, and encapsulation.

**4. Data Management**

The application's data is pretty simple at this point, so I opted to keep its state in the App component. Should the application grow in complexity, I would use a better data management strategy, such as a React context or even a dedicated library like Redux. Also, I chose to persist the state in the URL so it's easily shareable.

In addition, I'm also relying on TanStack queries caching and expiration capabilities to ensure data does not go stale and is efficiently cached.

## Technical Choices

- React
- Typescript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- TanStack Query
- Jest
- Playwright

**1. React + Vite + Typescript**

Vite significantly accelerates development with its fast server start-up and HMR, requiring minimal configuration, making it a good choice.

Typescript adds type safety, which helps catch errors more effectively and write more maintainable code.

**2. TailwindCSS for styling**

TailwindCSS is easy to use and speeds up some UI prototyping. Its ready-to-use design pieces mean less time writing custom code.

**3. Vitest for unit testing**

Vitest has fast test execution and seamless integration with Vite, which reduces potential maintenance effort.

**4. Playwright for end-to-end testing**

Playwright was chosen because it supports multiple browsers, offers powerful features like auto-waiting, and provides robust APIs for simulating user interactions. It's fast and reliable and enables cross-browser testing with a single codebase.


## Development instructions

**Dev environment setup**

Make sure to clone the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
You'll also need an API token from google, follow their [instructions](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862?hl=en).
